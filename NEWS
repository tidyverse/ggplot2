* order aesthetic now correctly affects position adjustments  (Fixes #70)
* qplot loads facetting variables from global environment more correctly
* scale_date and scale_date_time now work with infinite positions
* scale_date and scale_date_time now take expand argument
* scales were not getting automatically added in many situations (Fixes #69)
* stat_contour: fix error if x or y coordinates were negative
* stat_bin: now copes with bars of zero height (Fixes #72)
