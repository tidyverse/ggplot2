ggplot2 0.8.7 (2010-XX-XX) ----------------------------------------

* Fixed bug in stat_density2d when contour = FALSE (Thanks to takahashi kohske) 
* geom_point legend takes more care to ensure that fill colours will be shown
* legend: fixed scale merging bug when labels were set manually
* stat_bin: deals with floating point rounding issues using the same algorithm as base::hist
* fullseq: now always returns vector of length two, even when range is 0
* stat_bin2d: fix typo in breaks calculation
* scale_area: gains a legend argument like all other scales
