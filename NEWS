ggplot2 0.8.9 (2010-XX-XX) ----------------------------------------

A big thanks to Koshke Takahashi, who supplied the majority of improvements in this release!

GUIDE IMPROVEMENTS

* axis: can separately specify the x and y ticks.

* key size: can specify width and height separately

* axis: can partially handle text rotation (issue #149)

* legend: now can specify the direction of element by opts(legend.direction =
  "vertical") or opts(legend.direction = "horizontal"), and legend box is
  center aligned if horizontal

* legend: now can override the alignment of legend box by
  opts(legend.box = "vertical") or opts(legend.box = "horizontal")

* legend: now can override legend title alignment with opts(legend.title.align
  = 0) or opts(legend.title.align = 1)

* legend: can override legend text alignment with opts(legend.text.align = 0)
  or opts(legend.text.align = 1)

BUG FIXES

* theme_*: can specify font-family for all text elements other than geom_text

* facet_grid: fixed hirozontal spacing when nrow of horizontal strip >= 2

* facet_grid: now can manually specify the relative size of each row and column

* is.zero: now correctly works

* +: adding NULL to a plot returns the plot (idempotent under addition)
  (thanks to suggestion by Matthew O'Meara)

* +: meaningful error message if + doesn't know how to deal with an object
  type

* coord_cartesian and coord_flip: now can wisely zoom when wise = TRUE

* coord_polar: fix point division bugs

* facet_grid: now labels in facet_grid are correctly aligned when the number
  of factors is more then one (fixes #87 and #65)

* geom_hex: now correctly applies alpha to fill colour not outline colour
  (thanks to bug report from Ian Fellows)

* geom_polygon: specifying linetype now works (thanks to fix from Kohske
  Takahashi)

* hcl: can now set c and l, and preserves names (thanks to suggestion by
  Richard Cotton)

* mean_se: a new summary function to work with stat_summary that calculates
  mean and one standard error on either side (thanks to contribution from
  Kohske Takahashi)

* pos_stack: now works with NAs in x

* scale_alpha: setting limits to a range inside the data now works (thanks to
  report by Dr Proteome)

* scale_colour_continuous: works correctly with single continuous value (fixes
  #73)

* scale_identity: now show legends (fix #119)

* stat_function: now works without y values

* stat_smooth: draw line if only 2 unique x values, not three as previously *
  guides: fixed #126

* stat_smooth: once again works if n > 1000 and SE = F (thanks to bug report
  from Theiry Onkelinx and fix from Kohske Takahashi)

* stat_smooth: works with locfit (fix #129)

* theme_text handles alignment better when angle = 90

ggplot2 0.8.8 (2010-07-02) ----------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

* coord_equal finally works as expected (thanks to continued prompting from Jean-Olivier Irisson)
* coord_equal renamed to coord_fixed to better represent capabilities
* coord_polar and coord_polar: new munching system that uses distances (as defined by the coordinate system) to figure out how many pieces each segment should be broken in to (thanks to prompting from Jean-Olivier Irisson)
* fix ordering bug in facet_wrap (thanks to bug report by Frank Davenport)
* geom_errorh correctly responds to height parameter outside of aes
* geom_hline and geom_vline will not impact legend when used for fixed intercepts
* geom_hline/geom_vline: intercept values not set quite correctly which caused a problem in conjunction with transformed scales (reported by Seth Finnegan)
* geom_line: can now stack lines again with position = "stack" (fixes #74)
* geom_segment: arrows now preserved in non-Cartesian coordinate system (fixes #117)
* geom_smooth now deals with missing values in the same way as geom_line (thanks to patch from Karsten Loesing)
* guides: check all axis labels for expressions (reported by Benji Oswald)
* guides: extra 0.5 line margin around legend (fixes #71)
* guides: non-left legend positions now work once more (thanks to patch from Karsten Loesing)
* label_bquote works with more expressions (factors now cast to characters, thanks to Baptiste Auguie for bug report)
* scale_color: add missing US spellings
* stat: panels with no non-missing values trigged errors with some statistics. (reported by Giovanni Dall'Olio)
* stat: statistics now also respect layer parameter inherit.aes (thanks to bug report by Lorenzo Isella and investigation by Brian Diggs)
* stat_bin no longer drops 0-count bins by default
* stat_bin: fix small bug when dealing with single bin with NA position (reported by John Rauser)
* stat_binhex: uses range of data from scales when computing binwidth so hexes are the same size in all facets (thanks to Nicholas Lewin-Koh for the bug report)
* stat_qq has new dparam parameter for specifying distribution parameters (thanks to Yunfeng Zhang for the bug report)
* stat_smooth now uses built-in confidence interval (with small sample correction) for linear models (thanks to suggestion by Ian Fellows)
* stat_spoke: correctly calculate stat_spoke (cos and sin were flipped, thanks to Jean-Olivier Irisson for bug report and fix)
