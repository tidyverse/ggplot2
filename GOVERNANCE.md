# Overview
This project is led by a benevolent dictator and managed by a core team of developers and a large community of contributors and users. That is, the community and core developers actively contribute to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by the benevolent dictator. In case of disagreement, they have the last word.

# Roles And Responsibilities
## Benevolent dictator (Hadley Wickham, @hadley)
The job of the benevolent dictator is to set the strategic objectives of the project and communicate these clearly to the community, ensuring that the project survives in the long term. 

## [Core Developers](https://github.com/orgs/tidyverse/teams/ggplot2)
Core developers are contributors who have made several valuable contributions to the project and are now relied upon to write code directly to the repository and screen the contributions of others. Core developers are empowered to merge pull requests after careful review. Core developers have no authority over the overall direction of the project, however it is their job to help develop or elicit appropriate contributions to the project. As a matter of policy, core developers, even if no longer active, are listed (chronologicall) in [package authors](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/authors.html).

An invitation to join the core team will be extended to contributors who either have made a major contribution as a contributor, for example, they have added one major new feature or have a pattern of smaller contributions over an extended period of time. Any existing core developer can propose a contributor be invited to the core team, pending confirmation by existing authors.

## Contributors
Contributors are community members who make valuable contributions, such as those outlined in the list below, but generally do not have the authority to make direct changes to the project code. Instead, contributors can suggest changes to project code through the pull request process outlined in the project's [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) document. 

Anyone can become a contributor. There is no expectation of commitment to the project, no specific skill requirements and no selection process. To become a contributor, a community member simply has to perform one or more actions that are beneficial to the project.

Most contributors will already be engaging with the project as users, but will also find themselves doing one or more of the following:

- opening issues to report bugs or suggest new features
- submitting PRs to implement new features, fix bugs, or improve documentation
- commenting in open PRs or issues to help support users or contribute to discussion

## Users
Users are community members who have a need for the project. They are the most important members of the community: without them, the project would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no specific requirements.

Users are encouraged to participate in the life of the project and the community as much as possible. User contributions enable the project team to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. Common user activities include (but are not limited to):

- evangelising about the project
- informing developers of project strengths and weaknesses from a new user’s perspective
- providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)

Users who continue to engage with the project and its community will often find themselves becoming more and more involved. Such users may then go on to become contributors, as described above.

# Decision-Making Process
This project makes decisions according to a consensus model where suggestions
are considered and discussed between the community and core developers. In case 
of conflict, the project lead’s word is final. If the community chooses to question
the wisdom of the actions of a core developer, the project lead can review their
decision, and either uphold or reverse them.
