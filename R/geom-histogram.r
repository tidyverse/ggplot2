#' Histograms and frequency polygons
#'
#' Visualise the distribution of a single continuous variable by dividing
#' the x axis into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.
#' Histograms (\code{geom_histogram}) display the count with bars; frequency
#' polygons (\code{geom_freqpoly}), display the counts with lines. Frequency
#' polygons are more suitable when you want to compare the distribution
#' across a the levels of a categorical variable.
#'
#' By default, the underlying computation (\code{stat_bin}) uses 30 bins -
#' this is not a good default, but the idea is to get you experimenting with
#' different binwidths. You may need to look at a few to uncover the full
#' story behind your data.

#' @section Aesthetics:
#' \code{geom_histogram} uses the same aesthetics as \code{\link{geom_bar}};
#' \code{geom_freqpoly} uses the same aesthetics as \code{\link{geom_line}}.

#' # For transformed coordinate systems, the binwidth applies to the
#' # raw data. The bins have constant width on the original scale.
#'
#' # Using log scales does not work here, because the first
#' # bar is anchored at zero, and so when transformed becomes negative

#' # no observations have 0 ratings.
