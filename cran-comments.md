This is a small patch release preparing ggplot2 for changes in the ragg package.
Further it add infrastructure to help reverse dependencies gracefully prepare
for the next major ggplot2 release.

This release breaks a test in SimNPH, but we are in contact with them and a fix
for this should land on CRAN very soon.
