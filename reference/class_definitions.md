# Class definitions

The S7 object oriented programming system requires class definitions.
Here, we provide definitions of classes that are home to ggplot2.

## S7 classes

A general advice the S7 package gives is to name class definition
objects the same as the class name, which then becomes the constructor
for the class. The classes listed below deviate from that advice for
historical reasons, because some constructors like
[`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.md) are also
S3 generics with methods. The have the `class_`-prefix to indicate their
role.

- [`class_ggplot`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/class_ggplot.md)
  is an S7 class used for objects generated by
  [`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot.md).

- [`class_ggplot_built`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/class_ggplot_built.md)
  is an S7 class used for objects generated by
  [`ggplot_build()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggplot_build.md).

- [`class_mapping`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/class_mapping.md)
  is an S7 class used for objects generated by
  [`aes()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.md).

- [`class_theme`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/class_theme.md)
  is an S7 class used for objects generated by
  [`theme()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/theme.md).

- [`class_labels`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/class_labels.md)
  is an S7 class used for objects generated by
  [`labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/labs.md).

&nbsp;

- `class_gg` is an abstract S7 class to used invoke similar behaviour
  among ggplot objects.

## Theme elements

The theme elements follow the advice of the S7 package that the class
names are also the class definitions and constructors.

- [`element`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md) is an
  abstract S7 class used to invoke similar behaviour among theme element
  objects.

- [`element_blank`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for not drawing theme elements.

- [`element_rect`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for drawing rectangles.

- [`element_line`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for drawing lines.

- [`element_text`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for rendering text.

- [`element_polygon`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for drawing polygons.

- [`element_point`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class for drawing points.

- [`element_geom`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  is an S7 class holding geom defaults.

- [`margin`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md) is an
  S7 class for declaring margins.

## ggproto classes

The ggproto classes are S3 classes of the type environment that form the
backbone of most systems in ggplot2 and are in particular crucial to the
extension system.

- `class_ggproto` is an S3 class used for the objects generated by
  [`ggproto()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggproto.md)
  which are of the type environment.

&nbsp;

- `class_scale` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is more described
  in the [Scale](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Scale.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_guides` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is considered an
  internal class.

&nbsp;

- `class_guide` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is more described
  in the [Guide](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Guide.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_coord` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is more described
  in the [Coord](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Coord.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_facet` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is more described
  in the [Facet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Facet.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_layer` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is used for the
  objects generated by
  [`layer()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/layer.md). The
  class itself is considered internal and is described in more detail in
  the [Layer](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Layer-class.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_layout` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is considered an
  internal class. It is described in more detail in the
  [Layout](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/Layout.md)
  documentation.

&nbsp;

- `class_scales_list` is a subclass of `class_ggproto` and is considered
  an internal class.

## S3 classes

Some simple classes remain S3, primarily because they aren't meant to be
recycled into new classes.

- **\[superseded\]** `class_S3_gg` is a temporary S3 class until R 4.3.0
  is the minimum supported version. It is exported and listed here for
  completeness, but its use is heavily discouraged. It is superseded by
  `class_gg`.

&nbsp;

- `class_rel` is an S3 class used in
  [element](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/element.md)
  properties.

&nbsp;

- `class_zero_grob` is an S3 class used to indicate empty drawings.

&nbsp;

- `class_waiver` is an S3 sentinel value class used in various places.

&nbsp;

- `class_derive` is an S3 sentinel value class used primarily in
  [`sec_axis()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/sec_axis.md).
