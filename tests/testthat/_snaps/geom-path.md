# geom_path() throws meaningful error on bad combination of varying aesthetics

    Problem while converting geom to grob.
    i Error occurred in the 1st layer.
    Caused by error in `draw_panel()`:
    ! `geom_path()` can't have varying colour, size, and/or alpha along the line when linetype isn't solid
