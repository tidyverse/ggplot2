# aesthetic checking in geom throws correct errors

    Problem while setting up geom aesthetics.
    i Error occurred in the 1st layer.
    Caused by error in `use_defaults()`:
    ! Aesthetic modifiers returned invalid values
    x The following mappings are invalid
    x `colour = after_scale(data)`
    i Did you map the modifier in the wrong layer?

---

    Aesthetics must be either length 1 or the same as the data (4)
    x Fix the following mappings: `d` and `e`
