    Warning: no function found corresponding to methods exports from ‘XBSeq’ for: ‘conditions’, ‘conditions<-’, ‘dispTable’
    
    A namespace must be able to be loaded with just the base namespace
    loaded: otherwise if the namespace gets loaded by a saved object, the
    session will be unable to start.
    
    Probably some imports need to be declared in the NAMESPACE file.
