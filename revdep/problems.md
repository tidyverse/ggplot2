    Note: this function assumes your missing values
      are proper NAs, not "null",etc.
    
    It's best to impute NA values before running this function
    otherwise it may set averages to NA if there is 1 NA present.
    This function just removes any genes whose key is NA.
    
    You may get a warning here because key (usually gene) names are
      duplicated so it can't use them as row names. 
      That's OK, because we are immediately collapsing them into one feature.

    OMP: Error #15: Initializing libomp.dylib, but found libomp.dylib already initialized.
    OMP: Hint: This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results. For more information, please see http://www.intel.com/software/products/support/.
