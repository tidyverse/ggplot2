# Create a new sf layer that auto-maps geometry data

The `layer_sf()` function is a variant of
[`layer()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer.md) meant
to be used by extension developers who are writing new sf-based geoms or
stats. The sf layer checks whether the data contains a geometry column,
and if one is found it is automatically mapped to the `geometry`
aesthetic.

## Usage

``` r
layer_sf(
  geom = NULL,
  stat = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  mapping = NULL,
  position = NULL,
  params = list(),
  inherit.aes = TRUE,
  check.aes = TRUE,
  check.param = TRUE,
  show.legend = NA
)
```

## Arguments

- geom:

  The geometric object to use to display the data for this layer. When
  using a `stat_*()` function to construct a layer, the `geom` argument
  can be used to override the default coupling between stats and geoms.
  The `geom` argument accepts the following:

  - A `Geom` ggproto subclass, for example `GeomPoint`.

  - A string naming the geom. To give the geom as a string, strip the
    function name of the `geom_` prefix. For example, to use
    [`geom_point()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/geom_point.md),
    give the geom as `"point"`.

  - For more information and other ways to specify the geom, see the
    [layer
    geom](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_geoms.md)
    documentation.

- stat:

  The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer. When
  using a `geom_*()` function to construct a layer, the `stat` argument
  can be used to override the default coupling between geoms and stats.
  The `stat` argument accepts the following:

  - A `Stat` ggproto subclass, for example `StatCount`.

  - A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
    function name of the `stat_` prefix. For example, to use
    [`stat_count()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/geom_bar.md),
    give the stat as `"count"`.

  - For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
    [layer
    stat](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_stats.md)
    documentation.

- data:

  The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three options:

  - `NULL` (default): the data is inherited from the plot data as
    specified in the call to
    [`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/ggplot.md).

  - A `data.frame`, or other object, will override the plot data. All
    objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
    [`fortify()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/fortify.md)
    for which variables will be created.

  - A `function` will be called with a single argument, the plot data.
    The return value must be a `data.frame`, and will be used as the
    layer data. A `function` can be created from a `formula` (e.g.
    `~ head(.x, 10)`).

- mapping:

  Set of aesthetic mappings created by
  [`aes()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/aes.md). If
  specified and `inherit.aes = TRUE` (the default), it is combined with
  the default mapping at the top level of the plot. You must supply
  `mapping` if there is no plot mapping.

- position:

  A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be
  used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving
  the display. The `position` argument accepts the following:

  - The result of calling a position function, such as
    [`position_jitter()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/position_jitter.md).
    This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.

  - A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
    string, strip the function name of the `position_` prefix. For
    example, to use
    [`position_jitter()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/position_jitter.md),
    give the position as `"jitter"`.

  - For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
    [layer
    position](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_positions.md)
    documentation.

- params:

  Additional parameters to the `geom` and `stat`.

- inherit.aes:

  If `FALSE`, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining
  with them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both
  data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default
  plot specification, e.g.
  [`annotation_borders()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/annotation_borders.md).

- check.aes, check.param:

  If `TRUE`, the default, will check that supplied parameters and
  aesthetics are understood by the `geom` or `stat`. Use `FALSE` to
  suppress the checks.

- show.legend:

  Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? `NA`, the
  default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. `FALSE` never
  includes, and `TRUE` always includes. It can also be a named logical
  vector to finely select the aesthetics to display. To include legend
  keys for all levels, even when no data exists, use `TRUE`. If `NA`,
  all levels are shown in legend, but unobserved levels are omitted.
