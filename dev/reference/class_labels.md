# The labels class

The labels class holds a list with label information to display as
titles of plot components. The preferred way to construct an object of
the labels class is to use the
[`labs()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/labs.md)
function.

## Usage

``` r
class_labels(labels = list(), ...)
```

## Arguments

- labels:

  A named list.

- ...:

  Reserved for future expansion.

## Details

All members of `labels` are expected to be named and names should be
unique.
