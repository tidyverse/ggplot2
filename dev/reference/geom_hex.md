# Hexagonal heatmap of 2d bin counts

Divides the plane into regular hexagons, counts the number of cases in
each hexagon, and then (by default) maps the number of cases to the
hexagon fill. Hexagon bins avoid the visual artefacts sometimes
generated by the very regular alignment of
[`geom_bin_2d()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/geom_bin_2d.md).

## Usage

``` r
geom_hex(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  stat = "binhex",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  lineend = "butt",
  linejoin = "mitre",
  linemitre = 10,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)

stat_bin_hex(
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  geom = "hex",
  position = "identity",
  ...,
  binwidth = NULL,
  bins = 30,
  na.rm = FALSE,
  show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- mapping:

  Set of aesthetic mappings created by
  [`aes()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/aes.md). If
  specified and `inherit.aes = TRUE` (the default), it is combined with
  the default mapping at the top level of the plot. You must supply
  `mapping` if there is no plot mapping.

- data:

  The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three options:

  - `NULL` (default): the data is inherited from the plot data as
    specified in the call to
    [`ggplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/ggplot.md).

  - A `data.frame`, or other object, will override the plot data. All
    objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
    [`fortify()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/fortify.md)
    for which variables will be created.

  - A `function` will be called with a single argument, the plot data.
    The return value must be a `data.frame`, and will be used as the
    layer data. A `function` can be created from a `formula` (e.g.
    `~ head(.x, 10)`).

- position:

  A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This can be
  used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and improving
  the display. The `position` argument accepts the following:

  - The result of calling a position function, such as
    [`position_jitter()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/position_jitter.md).
    This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.

  - A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
    string, strip the function name of the `position_` prefix. For
    example, to use
    [`position_jitter()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/position_jitter.md),
    give the position as `"jitter"`.

  - For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
    [layer
    position](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_positions.md)
    documentation.

- ...:

  Other arguments passed on to
  [`layer()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer.md)'s
  `params` argument. These arguments broadly fall into one of 4
  categories below. Notably, further arguments to the `position`
  argument, or aesthetics that are required can *not* be passed through
  `...`. Unknown arguments that are not part of the 4 categories below
  are ignored.

  - Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
    value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example,
    `colour = "red"` or `linewidth = 3`. The geom's documentation has an
    **Aesthetics** section that lists the available options. The
    'required' aesthetics cannot be passed on to the `params`. Please
    note that while passing unmapped aesthetics as vectors is
    technically possible, the order and required length is not
    guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.

  - When constructing a layer using a `stat_*()` function, the `...`
    argument can be used to pass on parameters to the `geom` part of the
    layer. An example of this is
    `stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")`. The geom's
    documentation lists which parameters it can accept.

  - Inversely, when constructing a layer using a `geom_*()` function,
    the `...` argument can be used to pass on parameters to the `stat`
    part of the layer. An example of this is
    `geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)`. The stat's
    documentation lists which parameters it can accept.

  - The `key_glyph` argument of
    [`layer()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer.md)
    may also be passed on through `...`. This can be one of the
    functions described as [key
    glyphs](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/draw_key.md), to
    change the display of the layer in the legend.

- lineend:

  Line end style, one of `"round"`, `"butt"` or `"square"`.

- linejoin:

  Line join style, one of `"round"`, `"mitre"` or `"bevel"`.

- linemitre:

  Line mitre limit, a number greater than 1.

- na.rm:

  If `FALSE`, the default, missing values are removed with a warning. If
  `TRUE`, missing values are silently removed.

- show.legend:

  Logical. Should this layer be included in the legends? `NA`, the
  default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped. `FALSE` never
  includes, and `TRUE` always includes. It can also be a named logical
  vector to finely select the aesthetics to display. To include legend
  keys for all levels, even when no data exists, use `TRUE`. If `NA`,
  all levels are shown in legend, but unobserved levels are omitted.

- inherit.aes:

  If `FALSE`, overrides the default aesthetics, rather than combining
  with them. This is most useful for helper functions that define both
  data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from the default
  plot specification, e.g.
  [`annotation_borders()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/annotation_borders.md).

- geom, stat:

  Override the default connection between `geom_hex()` and
  `stat_bin_hex()`. For more information about overriding these
  connections, see how the
  [stat](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_stats.md) and
  [geom](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/layer_geoms.md)
  arguments work.

- binwidth:

  The width of the bins. Can be specified as a numeric value or as a
  function that takes x after scale transformation as input and returns
  a single numeric value. When specifying a function along with a
  grouping structure, the function will be called once per group. The
  default is to use the number of bins in `bins`, covering the range of
  the data. You should always override this value, exploring multiple
  widths to find the best to illustrate the stories in your data.

  The bin width of a date variable is the number of days in each time;
  the bin width of a time variable is the number of seconds.

- bins:

  Number of bins. Overridden by `binwidth`. Defaults to 30.

## Computed variables

These are calculated by the 'stat' part of layers and can be accessed
with [delayed
evaluation](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/aes_eval.md).

- `after_stat(count)`  
  number of points in bin.

- `after_stat(density)`  
  density of points in bin, scaled to integrate to 1.

- `after_stat(ncount)`  
  count, scaled to maximum of 1.

- `after_stat(ndensity)`  
  density, scaled to maximum of 1.

## Controlling binning parameters for the x and y directions

The arguments `bins` and `binwidth` can be set separately for the x and
y directions. When given as a scalar, one value applies to both
directions. When given as a vector of length two, the first is applied
to the x direction and the second to the y direction. Alternatively,
these can be a named list containing `x` and `y` elements, for example
`list(x = 10, y = 20)`.

## Examples

``` r
d <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price))
d + geom_hex()


# \donttest{
# You can control the size of the bins by specifying the number of
# bins in each direction:
d + geom_hex(bins = 10)

d + geom_hex(bins = 30)


# Or by specifying the width of the bins
d + geom_hex(binwidth = c(1, 1000))

d + geom_hex(binwidth = c(.1, 500))

# }
```
