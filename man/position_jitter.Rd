\title{Jitter points to avoid overplotting}
\usage{
position_jitter(width = NULL, height = NULL, seed = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{width, height}{Amount of vertical and horizontal jitter. The jitter
is added in both positive and negative directions, so the total spread
is twice the value specified here.

If omitted, defaults to 40\% of the resolution of the data: this means the
jitter values will occupy 80\% of the implied bins. Categorical data
is aligned on the integers, so a width or height of 0.5 will spread the
data so it's not possible to see the distinction between the categories.}

\item{seed}{A random seed to make the jitter reproducible.
Useful if you need to apply the same jitter twice, e.g., for a point and
a corresponding label.
The random seed is reset after jittering.
If \code{NA} (the default value), the seed is initialised with a random value;
this makes sure that two subsequent calls start with a different seed.
Use \code{NULL} to use the current random seed and also avoid resetting
(the behavior of \pkg{ggplot} 2.2.1 and earlier).}
}
\description{
Counterintuitively adding random noise to a plot can sometimes make it
easier to read. Jittering is particularly useful for small datasets with
at least one discrete position.
}
\examples{
# Jittering is useful when you have a discrete position, and a relatively
# small number of points
# take up as much space as a boxplot or a bar
ggplot(mpg, aes(class, hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot(colour = "grey50") +
  geom_jitter()

# If the default jittering is too much, as in this plot:
ggplot(mtcars, aes(am, vs)) +
  geom_jitter()

# You can adjust it in two ways
ggplot(mtcars, aes(am, vs)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(am, vs)) +
  geom_jitter(position = position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1))

# Create a jitter object for reproducible jitter:
jitter <- position_jitter(width = 0.1, height = 0.1)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(am, vs)) +
  geom_point(position = jitter) +
  geom_point(position = jitter, color = "red", aes(am + 0.2, vs + 0.2))
