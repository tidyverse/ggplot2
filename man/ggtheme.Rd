\describe{

\item{\code{theme_gray}}{
The signature ggplot2 theme with a grey background and white gridlines,
designed to put the data forward yet make comparisons easy.}

\item{\code{theme_bw}}{
The classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme. May work better for presentations
displayed with a projector.}

\item{\code{theme_linedraw}}{
A theme with only black lines of various widths on white backgrounds,
reminiscent of a line drawings. Serves a purpose similar to \code{theme_bw}.
Note that this theme has some very thin lines (<< 1 pt) which some journals
may refuse.}

\item{\code{theme_light}}{
A theme similar to \code{theme_linedraw} but with light grey lines and axes,
to direct more attention towards the data.}

\item{\code{theme_minimal}}{
A minimalistic theme with no background annotations.}

\item{\code{theme_classic}}{
A classic-looking theme, with x and y axis lines and no gridlines.}
