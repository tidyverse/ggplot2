\usage{
discrete_scale(aesthetics, scale_name, palette, name = waiver(),
  breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(), limits = NULL,
  expand = waiver(), na.translate = TRUE, na.value = NA,
  drop = TRUE, guide = "legend", position = "left",
  super = ScaleDiscrete)
}
\arguments{
\item{aesthetics}{The names of the aesthetics that this scale works with}

\item{scale_name}{The name of the scale}

\item{palette}{A palette function that when called with a single integer
argument (the number of levels in the scale) returns the values that
they should take.}

\item{name}{The name of the scale. Used as the axis or legend title. If
\code{waiver()}, the default, the name of the scale is taken from the first
mapping used for that aesthetic. If \code{NULL}, the legend title will be
omitted.}

\item{breaks}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no breaks
\item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks computed by the
transformation object
\item A character vector of breaks
\item A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks
as output
}}

\item{labels}{One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} for no labels
\item \code{waiver()} for the default labels computed by the
transformation object
\item A character vector giving labels (must be same length as \code{breaks})
\item A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels
as output
}}

\item{limits}{A character vector that defines possible values of the scale
and their order.}

\item{expand}{Vector of range expansion constants used to add some
padding around the data, to ensure that they are placed some distance
away from the axes. Use the convenience function \code{\link[=expand_scale]{expand_scale()}}
to generate the values for the \code{expand} argument. The defaults are to
expand the scale by 5\% on each side for continuous variables, and by
0.6 units on each side for discrete variables.}

\item{na.translate}{Unlike continuous scales, discrete scales can easily show
missing values, and do so by default. If you want to remove missing values
from a discrete scale, specify \code{na.translate = FALSE}.}

\item{na.value}{If \code{na.translate = TRUE}, what value aesthetic
value should missing be displayed as? Does not apply to position scales
where \code{NA} is always placed at the far right.}

\item{drop}{Should unused factor levels be omitted from the scale?
The default, \code{TRUE}, uses the levels that appear in the data;
\code{FALSE} uses all the levels in the factor.}

\item{guide}{A function used to create a guide or its name. See
\code{\link[=guides]{guides()}} for more info.}

\item{position}{The position of the axis. "left" or "right" for vertical
scales, "top" or "bottom" for horizontal scales}

\item{super}{The super class to use for the constructed scale}
