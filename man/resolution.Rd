\title{Compute the "resolution" of a data vector.}
\usage{
resolution(x, zero = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric vector}

\item{zero}{should a zero value be automatically included in the
computation of resolution}
}
\description{
The resolution is the smallest non-zero distance between adjacent
values.  If there is only one unique value, then the resolution is defined
to be one.
}
\details{
If x is an integer vector, then it is assumed to represent a discrete
variable, and the resolution is 1.
}
\examples{
resolution(1:10)
resolution((1:10) - 0.5)
resolution((1:10) - 0.5, FALSE)
resolution(c(1,2, 10, 20, 50))
resolution(as.integer(c(1, 10, 20, 50)))  # Returns 1
}
