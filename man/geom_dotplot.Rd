\usage{
geom_dotplot(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, position = "identity",
  na.rm = FALSE, binwidth = NULL, binaxis = "x", method = "dotdensity",
  binpositions = "bygroup", stackdir = "up", stackratio = 1,
  dotsize = 1, stackgroups = FALSE, origin = NULL, right = TRUE,
  width = 0.9, drop = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You only need to supply \code{mapping} if there isn't a mapping
defined for the plot.}

\item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{binwidth}{When \code{method} is "dotdensity", this specifies maximum bin
width. When \code{method} is "histodot", this specifies bin width.
Defaults to 1/30 of the range of the data}

\item{binaxis}{The axis to bin along, "x" (default) or "y"}

\item{method}{"dotdensity" (default) for dot-density binning, or
"histodot" for fixed bin widths (like stat_bin)}

\item{binpositions}{When \code{method} is "dotdensity", "bygroup" (default)
determines positions of the bins for each group separately. "all" determines
positions of the bins with all the data taken together; this is used for
aligning dot stacks across multiple groups.}

\item{stackdir}{which direction to stack the dots. "up" (default),
"down", "center", "centerwhole" (centered, but with dots aligned)}

\item{stackratio}{how close to stack the dots. Default is 1, where dots just
just touch. Use smaller values for closer, overlapping dots.}

\item{dotsize}{The diameter of the dots relative to \code{binwidth}, default 1.}

\item{stackgroups}{should dots be stacked across groups? This has the effect
that \code{position = "stack"} should have, but can't (because this geom has
some odd properties).}

\item{origin}{When \code{method} is "histodot", origin of first bin}

\item{right}{When \code{method} is "histodot", should intervals be closed
on the right (a, b], or not [a, b)}

\item{width}{When \code{binaxis} is "y", the spacing of the dot stacks
for dodging.}

\item{drop}{If TRUE, remove all bins with zero counts}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. There are
  three types of arguments you can use here:

  \itemize{
  \item Aesthetics: to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
     \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}.
  \item Other arguments to the layer, for example you override the
    default \code{stat} associated with the layer.
  \item Other arguments passed on to the stat.

\description{
In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width
(or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are
stacked, with each dot representing one observation.
}
\details{
With dot-density binning, the bin positions are determined by the data and
\code{binwidth}, which is the maximum width of each bin. See Wilkinson
(1999) for details on the dot-density binning algorithm.

With histodot binning, the bins have fixed positions and fixed widths, much
like a histogram.

When binning along the x axis and stacking along the y axis, the numbers on
y axis are not meaningful, due to technical limitations of ggplot2. You can
hide the y axis, as in one of the examples, or manually scale it
to match the number of dots.
