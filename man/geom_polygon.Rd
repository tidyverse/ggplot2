\usage{
geom_polygon(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
   options:

   If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
   data as specified in the call to \code{\link{ggplot}}.

   A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
   data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
   \code{\link{fortify}} for which variables will be created.

   A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
   the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame.}, and
   will be used as the layer data.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\description{
Polygons are very similar to paths (as drawn by \code{\link{geom_path}})
except that the start and end points are connected and the inside is
coloured by \code{fill}. The \code{group} aesthetic determines which cases
are connected together into a polygon.

\examples{
# When using geom_polygon, you will typically need two data frames:
# one contains the coordinates of each polygon (positions),  and the
# other the values associated with each polygon (values).  An id
# variable links the two together

ids <- factor(c("1.1", "2.1", "1.2", "2.2", "1.3", "2.3"))

values <- data.frame(
  id = ids,
  value = c(3, 3.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 3.5)
)

positions <- data.frame(
  id = rep(ids, each = 4),
  x = c(2, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 1, 0, 0.3, 1.1, 2.2, 1.1, 1.2, 2.5, 1.1, 0.3,
  0.5, 1.2, 2.5, 1.2, 1.3, 2.7, 1.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1.3),
  y = c(-0.5, 0, 1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 2.1, 1.7, 1, 1.5,
  2.2, 2.1, 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, 2.8, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 3.2)
)

# Currently we need to manually merge the two together
datapoly <- merge(values, positions, by = c("id"))

p <- ggplot(datapoly, aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(fill = value, group = id))
p

# Which seems like a lot of work, but then it's easy to add on
# other features in this coordinate system, e.g.:

stream <- data.frame(
  x = cumsum(runif(50, max = 0.1)),
  y = cumsum(runif(50,max = 0.1))
)

p + geom_line(data = stream, colour = "grey30", size = 5)

# And if the positions are in longitude and latitude, you can use
# coord_map to produce different map projections.
