\title{Polygon, a filled path.}
\usage{
geom_polygon(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You only need to supply \code{mapping} if there isn't a mapping
defined for the plot.}

\item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. There are
  three types of arguments you can use here:

  \itemize{
  \item Aesthetics: to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
     \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}.
  \item Other arguments to the layer, for example you override the
    default \code{stat} associated with the layer.
  \item Other arguments passed on to the stat.

\examples{
# When using geom_polygon, you will typically need two data frames:
# one contains the coordinates of each polygon (positions),  and the
# other the values associated with each polygon (values).  An id
# variable links the two together

ids <- factor(c("1.1", "2.1", "1.2", "2.2", "1.3", "2.3"))

values <- data.frame(
  id = ids,
  value = c(3, 3.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.15, 3.5)
)

positions <- data.frame(
  id = rep(ids, each = 4),
  x = c(2, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 1, 0, 0.3, 1.1, 2.2, 1.1, 1.2, 2.5, 1.1, 0.3,
  0.5, 1.2, 2.5, 1.2, 1.3, 2.7, 1.2, 0.5, 0.6, 1.3),
  y = c(-0.5, 0, 1, 0.5, 0, 0.5, 1.5, 1, 0.5, 1, 2.1, 1.7, 1, 1.5,
  2.2, 2.1, 1.7, 2.1, 3.2, 2.8, 2.1, 2.2, 3.3, 3.2)
)

# Currently we need to manually merge the two together
datapoly <- merge(values, positions, by=c("id"))

(p <- ggplot(datapoly, aes(x=x, y=y)) + geom_polygon(aes(fill=value, group=id)))

# Which seems like a lot of work, but then it's easy to add on
# other features in this coordinate system, e.g.:

stream <- data.frame(
  x = cumsum(runif(50, max = 0.1)),
  y = cumsum(runif(50,max = 0.1))
)

p + geom_line(data = stream, colour="grey30", size = 5)

# And if the positions are in longitude and latitude, you can use
# coord_map to produce different map projections.
