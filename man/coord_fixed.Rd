\title{Cartesian coordinates with fixed relationship between x and y scales.}
\usage{
  coord_fixed(ratio = 1, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL,
    wise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{ratio}{aspect ratio, expressed as \code{y / x}}

  \item{xlim}{limits for the x axis}

  \item{ylim}{limits for the y axis}

  \item{wise}{If \code{TRUE} will wisely expand the actual
  range of the plot a little, in the way that setting the
  limits on the scales does}
}
\description{
  A fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio
  between the physical representation of data units on the
  axes. The ratio represents the number of units on the
  y-axis equivalent to one unit on the x-axis. The default,
  \code{ratio = 1}, ensures that one unit on the x-axis is
  the same length as one unit on the y-axis. Ratios higher
  than one make units on the y axis longer than units on
  the x-axis, and vice versa. This is similar to
  \code{\link[MASS]{eqscplot}}, but it works for all types
  of graphics.
}
\examples{
# ensures that the ranges of axes are equal to the specified ratio by
# adjusting the plot aspect ratio

qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_fixed(ratio = 5)
qplot(mpg, wt, data = mtcars) + coord_fixed(ratio = 1/5)

# Resize the plot to see that the specified aspect ratio is maintained
