\title{Cartesian coordinates with fixed "aspect ratio"}
\usage{
coord_fixed(ratio = 1, xlim = NULL, ylim = NULL, expand = TRUE,
  clip = "on")
}
\arguments{
\item{ratio}{aspect ratio, expressed as \code{y / x}}

\item{xlim}{Limits for the x and y axes.}

\item{ylim}{Limits for the x and y axes.}

\item{expand}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, adds a small expansion factor to
the limits to ensure that data and axes don't overlap. If \code{FALSE},
limits are taken exactly from the data or \code{xlim}/\code{ylim}.}

\item{clip}{Should drawing be clipped to the extent of the plot panel? A
setting of \code{"on"} (the default) means yes, and a setting of \code{"off"}
means no. In most cases, the default of \code{"on"} should not be changed,
as setting \code{clip = "off"} can cause unexpected results. It allows
drawing of data points anywhere on the plot, including in the plot margins. If
limits are set via \code{xlim} and \code{ylim} and some data points fall outside those
limits, then those data points may show up in places such as the axes, the
legend, the plot title, or the plot margins.}

\description{
A fixed scale coordinate system forces a specified ratio between the
physical representation of data units on the axes. The ratio represents the
number of units on the y-axis equivalent to one unit on the x-axis. The
default, \code{ratio = 1}, ensures that one unit on the x-axis is the same
length as one unit on the y-axis. Ratios higher than one make units on the
y axis longer than units on the x-axis, and vice versa. This is similar to
\code{\link[MASS:eqscplot]{MASS::eqscplot()}}, but it works for all types of graphics.
}
\examples{
# ensures that the ranges of axes are equal to the specified ratio by
# adjusting the plot aspect ratio

p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, wt)) + geom_point()
p + coord_fixed(ratio = 1)
p + coord_fixed(ratio = 5)
p + coord_fixed(ratio = 1/5)
p + coord_fixed(xlim = c(15, 30))

# Resize the plot to see that the specified aspect ratio is maintained
