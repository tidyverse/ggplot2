coord_munch(coord, data, range, segment_length = 0.01, is_closed = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{coord}{Coordinate system definition.}

\item{data}{Data set to transform - should have variables \code{x} and
\code{y} are chopped up into small pieces (as defined by \code{group}).
All other variables are duplicated as needed.}

\item{range}{Panel range specification.}

\item{segment_length}{Target segment length}

\item{is_closed}{Whether data should be considered as a closed polygon.}
}

so they can be transformed independently. Used inside geom functions.
