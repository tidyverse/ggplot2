\description{
  Make a parallel coordinates plot.
}

\details{
  One way to think about a parallel coordinates plot, is as
  plotting the data after it has been transformed to gain a
  new variable.  This function does this using
  \code{\link[reshape]{melt}}.

  This gives us enormous flexibility as we have separated
  out the type of drawing (lines by tradition) and can now
  use any of the existing geom functions.  In particular
  this makes it very easy to create parallel boxplots, as
  shown in the example.

  Three different scaling function are available:

  \itemize{ \item "range": scale coordinates to have common
  range $[0, 1] \item "var": scale coordinates to have mean
  0 and variance 1 \item "I": don't scale the coordinates
  at all }
}
\arguments{
  \item{data}{data frame}
  \item{vars}{variables to include in parallel coordinates plot}
  \item{scale}{scaling function, one of "range", "var" or "I"}
  \item{...}{other arguments passed on plot creation}
}
\examples{ggpcp(mtcars) + geom_line()
ggpcp(mtcars, scale="var") + geom_line()
ggpcp(mtcars, vars=names(mtcars)[3:6], formula= . ~cyl, scale="I") + geom_line()
ggpcp(mtcars, scale="I") + geom_boxplot(aes(group=variable))
ggpcp(mtcars, vars=names(mtcars[2:6])) + geom_line()
p <- ggpcp(mtcars, vars=names(mtcars[2:6]))
p + geom_line()
p + geom_line(aes(colour=mpg))}
