\title{Scale area instead of radius, for size.}
\usage{
scale_size_area(..., max_size = 6)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link{continuous_scale}}
to control name, limits, breaks, labels and so forth.}

\item{max_size}{Size of largest points.}
}
\description{
When \code{scale_size_area} is used, the default behavior is to scale the
area of points to be proportional to the value.
}
\details{
Note that this controls the size scale, so it will also control
the thickness of lines. Line thickness will be proportional to the square
root of the value, which is probably undesirable in most cases.
