\usage{
continuous_scale(aesthetics, scale_name, palette, name = waiver(),
  breaks = waiver(), minor_breaks = waiver(), labels = waiver(),
  limits = NULL, rescaler = rescale, oob = censor, expand = waiver(),
  na.value = NA_real_, trans = "identity", guide = "legend",
  position = "left", super = ScaleContinuous)
}
\arguments{
\item{aesthetics}{the names of the aesthetics that this scale works with}

\item{scale_name}{the name of the scale}

\item{palette}{a palette function that when called with a single integer
argument (the number of levels in the scale) returns the values that
they should take}

\item{name}{The name of the scale. Used as axis or legend title. If
\code{NULL}, the default, the name of the scale is taken from the first
mapping used for that aesthetic.}

\item{breaks}{One of: \itemize{
  \item \code{NULL} for no breaks
  \item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks computed by the
    transformation object
  \item A numeric vector of positions
  \item A function that takes the limits as input and returns breaks
    as output
}}

\item{minor_breaks}{One of: \itemize{
  \item \code{NULL} for no minor breaks
  \item \code{waiver()} for the default breaks (one minor break between
    each major break)
  \item A numeric vector of positions
  \item A function that given the limits returns a vector of minor breaks.
}}

\item{labels}{One of: \itemize{
  \item \code{NULL} for no labels
  \item \code{waiver()} for the default labels computed by the
    transformation object
  \item A character vector giving labels (must be same length as \code{breaks})
  \item A function that takes the breaks as input and returns labels
    as output
}}

\item{limits}{A numeric vector of length two providing limits of the scale.
Use \code{NA} to refer to the existing minimum or maximum.}

\item{rescaler}{Used by diverging and n colour gradients
(i.e. \code{\link{scale_colour_gradient2}}, \code{\link{scale_colour_gradientn}}).
A function used to scale the input values to the range [0, 1].}

\item{oob}{Function that handles limits outside of the scale limits
(out of bounds). The default replaces out of bounds values with NA.}

\item{expand}{A numeric vector of length two giving multiplicative and
additive expansion constants. These constants ensure that the data is
placed some distance away from the axes. The defaults are
\code{c(0.05, 0)} for continuous variables, and \code{c(0, 0.6)} for
discrete variables.}

\item{na.value}{Missing values will be replaced with this value.}

\item{trans}{Either the name of a transformation object, or the
  object itself. Built-in transformations include "asn", "atanh",
  "boxcox", "exp", "identity", "log", "log10", "log1p", "log2",
  "logit", "probability", "probit", "reciprocal", "reverse" and "sqrt".

  A transformation object bundles together a transform, it's inverse,
  and methods for generating breaks and labels. Transformation objects
  are defined in the scales package, and are called \code{name_trans}, e.g.
  \code{\link[scales]{boxcox_trans}}. You can create your own
  transformation with \code{\link[scales]{trans_new}}.}

\item{guide}{Name of guide object, or object itself.}

\item{position}{The position of the axis. "left" or "right" for vertical
scales, "top" or "bottom" for horizontal scales}

\item{super}{The super class to use for the constructed scale}
