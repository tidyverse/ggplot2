\title{Blank, draws nothing.}
\usage{
geom_blank(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You only need to supply \code{mapping} if there isn't a mapping
defined for the plot.}

\item{data}{A data frame. If specified, overrides the default data frame
defined at the top level of the plot.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. There are
  three types of arguments you can use here:

  \itemize{
  \item Aesthetics: to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
     \code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}.
  \item Other arguments to the layer, for example you override the
    default \code{stat} associated with the layer.
  \item Other arguments passed on to the stat.

\description{
The blank geom draws nothing, but can be a useful way of ensuring common
scales between different plots.

\examples{
ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg)) + geom_blank()
# Nothing to see here!

# Take the following scatter plot
a <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg), . ~ cyl) + geom_point()
# Add to that some lines with geom_abline()
df <- data.frame(a = rnorm(10, 25), b = rnorm(10, 0))
a + geom_abline(aes(intercept = a, slope = b), data = df)
# Suppose you then wanted to remove the geom_point layer
# If you just remove geom_point, you will get an error
b <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))
\dontrun{b + geom_abline(aes(intercept = a, slope = b), data = df)}
# Switching to geom_blank() gets the desired plot
c <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + geom_blank()
c + geom_abline(aes(intercept = a, slope = b), data = df)
