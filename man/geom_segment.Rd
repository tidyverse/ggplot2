\usage{
geom_segment(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt",
  na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)

geom_curve(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", ..., curvature = 0.5, angle = 90, ncp = 5,
  arrow = NULL, lineend = "butt", na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA,
  inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link{aes}} or
\code{\link{aes_}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
   options:

   If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
   data as specified in the call to \code{\link{ggplot}}.

   A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
   data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
   \code{\link{fortify}} for which variables will be created.

   A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
   the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame.}, and
   will be used as the layer data.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link{layer}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{arrow}{specification for arrow heads, as created by arrow()}

\item{lineend}{Line end style (round, butt, square)}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE} (the default), removes missing values with
a warning.  If \code{TRUE} silently removes missing values.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link{borders}}.}

\item{curvature}{A numeric value giving the amount of curvature.
    Negative values produce left-hand curves, positive values
    produce right-hand curves, and zero produces a straight line.}

\item{angle}{A numeric value between 0 and 180,
    giving an amount to skew the control
    points of the curve.  Values less than 90 skew the curve towards
    the start point and values greater than 90 skew the curve
    towards the end point.}

\item{ncp}{The number of control points used to draw the curve.
    More control points creates a smoother curve.}
}
\description{
\code{geom_segment} draws a straight line between points (x1, y1) and
(x2, y2). \code{geom_curve} draws a curved line.

# You can also use geom_segment to recreate plot(type = "h") :
counts <- as.data.frame(table(x = rpois(100,5)))
counts$x <- as.numeric(as.character(counts$x))
with(counts, plot(x, Freq, type = "h", lwd = 10))

ggplot(counts, aes(x, Freq)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = x, yend = 0), size = 10, lineend = "butt")
