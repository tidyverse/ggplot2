ggplot2 0.8.5 (2009-12-15) ----------------------------------------

New features

* geom_text gains parse argument which makes it possible to display
  expressions. (Implements #50)

* all scales now have legend parameter, which defaults to TRUE. Setting to
  false will prevent that scale from contributing to the legend (Implements
  #27)

* default axis labels and legend titles are now stored in the options, instead
  of in each scale. This fixes a long standing bug where it was not easy to
  set the label for computed variable, such as the y axis on a histogram.
  Additionally, it means default scales are only added to the plot until just
  prior to plotting, instead of the previous behaviour where scales where
  added as layers were added - this could cause problems if you later modified
  the underlying data. (Implements #28)

* coord_equal: when ratio = NULL (the default), it will adjust the aspect
  ratio of the plot, rather than trying to extend the shortest axis.

* x and y positions can be set to Inf or -Inf to refer to the top/right and 
  bottom/left extents of the panel. (Implements #18)

* expand_limits(): a new function to make it easy to force the inclusion of 
  any set of values in the limits of any aesthetic.

New features (minor)

* aesthetics: when _setting_ an aesthetic, you may only set it to a single 
  value.  This was always a good idea, but now it is enforced with an 
  informative error message.
* stat_contour bump up default number of contours
* stat_density2d: make number of grid points used for density estimation 
  user controllable (implements #9)
* geom_bin now allows you to set whether bins used intervals of the form 
  (a, b] or [a, b) with the "right" parameter (implements #20)
* geom_path: linejoin, lineend and linemitre are now user controllable 
  (implements #24)
* scales: all scales check that breaks are supplied if labels are, and 
  that breaks and labels are the same length (implements #40)
* scales: if breaks are a named vector, the names will be used as labels
  (thanks to suggestion by David Kahle)
* scale_colour_gradient, scale_colour_gradient2 & scale_colour_gradientn now
  have formatter argument to match scale_continuous
* updated citation to refer to the ggplot2 book

Bug fixes

* coord_cartesian now correctly sets limits when one or both of the position
  scales are non-linear.  (fixes #17)
* coord_equal: now works with non-linear scales (fixes #13)
* coord_map sets aspect ratio correctly (fixes #4)
* coord_polar correctly combines labels on end of axis if expressions
  (fixes #39)
* coord_trans now respects scale expand parameter (expansion occurs after 
  transformation) (fixes #14)
* facet_grid with scales = "free" and space = "free" now calculates space 
  correctly if the range of the scale is < 1 (fixes #1)
* facet_grid works once more when facetting with multiple variables in one
  direction (fixes #11)
* facet_wrap now sets aspect ratio correctly
* facet_wrap now maintains original order of data
* geom_hline and geom_vline now work with coord_flip (fixes #30)
* geom_path drops missing values at start and end of each line (fixes #41)
* scale_shape_discrete, scale_size_continuous, scale_alpha and
  scale_linetype_discrete added to scales to match naming convention of all
  other scales (fixes #47)
* legends now correctly calculate label widths (fixes #38)
* legends will only merge if both the title and all labels are the same.
  (fixes #16)
* legends: fix for bug #19: Legend with three constraints doesn't work 
* stat_contour & stat_density2d: fix grouping bugs (issue #7)
* xlim, ylim: fix bug when setting limits of discrete scales

* aesthetics: corrected list of aesthetics to include american spelling of
  colour as well as base R abbreviations

* facet_wrap: can now specify both ncol and nrow without getting an error
* facet_wrap: now works with statistics that produce both x and y values (e.g.
  stat_qq)

  include.lowest argument in cut never comes into play (this the source of a
  potential bug in histograms)
* geom_boxplot: alpha now affects fill colour of boxes only
* geom_path correctly switches to segments if varying alpha used (thanks to
  Karl Ove Hufthammer for the report and Baptiste Auguie for the fix)

  didn't try for only 1 point)
* stat_spoke now works with reversed scales
* grouping: now consistent between different geoms (Issue #33)

ggplot2 0.8.3  (2009-04-20)

* cut_interval and cut_number utility functions to discretise continuous variables

* stat_summary has reparameterised to make it easier to specify different summary functions.  It now has four parameters: fun.y, fun.ymin and fun.ymax; and fun.data.  See the documentation for stat_summary for more details

ggplot2 0.8  (2008-11-18)
----------------------------------------

The two biggest new features in this release are the (long awaited) ability to have scales that vary between facets, and a faceting system that works like lattice (facet_wrap). From qplot, you can use facet_wrap by specifying one sided formula (~ colour, as opposed to . ~ color). To see some potential uses for these new features, see the "Positioning" chapter of the book.  Implementing these changes has required a rewrite of large parts of the coordinate systems code, so if anything seems strange with non-Cartesian coordinate systems, please get in touch.

I've also made another round of tweaks to make the plots more aesthetically pleasing.  This includes using a bright blue colour for geoms used to add statistical summaries to plots (contour, smooth, and quantiles), and tweaking the default colour scheme for the continuous colour scale.  Please let me know what you think.  Remember that most of these options are controllable with the theming system - see the book chapter "Polishing your plots for publication".

Accompanying this new release of the package is an updated and expanded version of the book.  The content of the book is now largely complete (~170 pages), and over the coming months I will be working on make it polished and easy to understand.  See http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book.  I love to hear your feedback about the book, but at this point please don't bother reporting minor typos, I would much rather hear about what you want to do, but can't figure out from the book.

Other new features:

* geom_bin2d/stat_bin2d & geom_hex/stat_binhex: for 2d square and hexagon binning, particularly useful for alleviating overplotting in scatterplots
* geom_freqpoly: draws frequency polygons (= stat_bin + geom_line)
* scale_position: both discrete and continuous gain a new formatter argument to control the default formatting of the axis labels.  See also the handy numeric formatters: dollar, comma and percent
* the xlim and ylim functions now produce discrete scales when appropriate, and generate a reverse scale if the minimum is greater than the maximum

Improvements

* coord_map gains experimental axis labels
* facet_grid: new support for varying scales in rows and columns
* facet_wrap: new faceter which wraps a 1d ribbon of panels into 2d, in a similar way to lattice
* geom_bin: gains a drop argument to control whether or not 0 count bins should be removed
* geom_path and geom_line gain arrows argument to match geom_segment
* ggsave now checks that you are using it with a ggplot plot
* ggsave now produces postscript files that are suitable for embedding in another document
* ggsave now recognises the .svg extension and will produce svg files, if possible
* ggsave: default dpi changed to 300, on the assumption that you are saving the plot for printing
* qplot: uses facet_wrap if formula looks like ~ a + b (as opposed to a ~ b)

Aesthetic tweaks

* geom_bar, geom_polygon, geom_rect, ...: default fill colour is now much closer to black to match the defaults in other geoms (point, line, etc)
* geom_line, geom_path, geom_segment: lines have squared ends
* geom_point, geom_pointrange and geom_boxplot: now use shape = 16 instead of 19.  This shape does not have a border from R 2.8 on, and so will look better when displayed transparently.
* geom_contour, geom_density2d, geom_quantile and geom_smooth use a bright blue colour for lines, to make them stand out when used with black points
* scale_gradient: tweaked default colours to make more aesthetically pleasing
* theme: new theme setting panel.margin (a unit) controls gap between panels in facetted plots (for both grid and wrap)
* theme_gray: removed black border around strips
* theme_bw: tweaks to make black and white theme look a little nicer

Bug fixes

* coord_cartesian now correctly clips instead of dropping points outside of its limits
* facet_grid: margins now grouped correctly in default case (non-aesthetic variables ignored when generating default group value)
* facet_grid: fix long standing bug when combining datasets with different levels of facetting variable
* geom_smooth calls stat::predict explicitly to avoid conflicts with packages that override predict for S4 model classes
* grid: correctly expose subcomponents of strips and axes
* mapping aesthetics to functions of stat output now works in a much wider variety of cases
* order aesthetic should now work with bars (and in general more geoms)
* position_dodge now works with points and other geoms that lack xmin and xmax
* scale_area works once more
* scale_discrete_position: empty levels are no longer displayed by default, if you want them, use breaks = levels(myfactor)
* scale_discrete_position: fixed bug when limits were set
* scale_discrete_position: more aesthetically pleasing expansion for a wider ranges of plots (picks expansion based on whether or not geom with width used, e.g. bars)
* scale_gradient*: axes are correctly labelled when a transformation is used
* scale_x_log10, scale_y_sqrt etc now correctly transform output from statistics as well as raw data
* scale_z_* now removed because no longer used by anything
* stat_bin: correctly returns 0 when no observations in a bin (was previously returning NA)
* stat_quantreg: deal with yet another new output format from quantreg
* stat_contour now has arguments to control the position of the contours, rather than relying on the z scale
* theme: panel.empty setting removed as it is no longer used
* theme_grey now aliased to theme_gray
* theme_line: setting size works correctly
* theme_rect, theme_segment: size now measured in mm, to be consistent with the rest of ggplot

See CHANGELOG for changes in previous versions

ggplot2 0.7  (2008-11-18)
----------------------------------------

ggplot2 0.7 introduces a new theming system which allows you to control (almost) every aspect of the appearance of the plot.  This system is documented in the book chapter "Polishing your plots for publication", available from http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/book/polishing.pdf.

Bugs fixed

* geom_boxplot: now displays outliers even if only one present 
* geom_jitter: setting one jitter direction to 0 now works
* geom_segment: should now work correctly in all coordinate systems (note that arrows only work in Cartesian coordinates)
* ggsave: correctly uses dpi for raster devices and default dpi changed to 72 (thanks to Brian Ripley for pointing this out)
* ggsave: current device no longer closes if error occurs
* position_jitter: now works correctly with 0 jitter
* remove_missing: some statistics were calculated incorrectly when missing values were present
* scales: extra scales ignored (again)
* scales: legends respect fixed parameters of the layer
* scales: legends won't appear when aesthetics are mapped to NULL, or set to fixed value
* scales: xend and yend now transformed correctly
* scale_date: breaks are now rounded to correct position

New functionality

* geom_point: can now control colour and fill separately for point glyphs with borders
* geom_step: now has parameter direction which can take values vh (vertical then horizontal) or hv (horizontal then vertical) describing the shape of the stairs
* qplot: new asp argument to set aspect ratio
* qplot: now captures the environment in which it was run, which should make it much more robust at finding the variables you expect it to find 
* qplot: now treats any arguments wrapped in I() as parameters, not aesthetics, e.g. qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars, colour = I("red")) or qplot(mpg, wt, data=mtcars, size = I(5))
* scale_continuous: new minor_breaks argument to controls position of minor breaks
* scale_discrete: new discrete position scales which make it possible to manually position elements
* scale_gradientn: new colour scale which creates gradient between any list of colours

More consistent interfaces

* can use color instead of colour, and old R names throughout ggplot2
* geom_jitter: Arguments changed to height and width to match other position adjustments
* scales: any point outside of limits is dropped (this was previously the behaviour for discrete scales, but not continuous scales)
* scales: limits are consistent across discrete and continuous scales (limits c(1, NA) form no longer works for continuous scales)
* scales: order of legends reversed to match order of x axis (and to be consistent with previous versions)
* scale_date: new limits argument to set axis limits
* scale_discrete: all discrete scales accept breaks argument
* scale_discrete: all discrete scales have limits and labels argument to better control legends
* scale_discrete: character and logical vectors now reliably treated as discrete scales
* stat_density2d, geom_density2d: density2d used consistently (instead of density_2d in some places)

Improved aesthetics

* coord_polar: more tweaks to grid lines to enhance appearance
* coord_polar: new expand argument to control whether axes should be expanded outside the range of the data
* geom_contour, geom_smooth, geom_quantile: now use blue lines
* position_stack, position_dodge: should be more informative if conditions for stacking/dodging not met
* position_jitter: default amount of jittering tweaked to align with boxplots etc.
* scales: background colour of legends key matches plot
* themes: Complete rewrite of theming system, see new book chapter for details
* themes: direct access to plot options via $ is now disabled

Improved documentation and error messages

* facet_grid: documentation improved
* qplot: Better error messages when needed variables are missing
* scale_discrete: improved error message for too many values in domain
* scale_size: improved documentation for discrete variables
* online documentation generally tweaked and primped to work a little better and look a little nicer
* website now includes a search box
* links from rdoc now point to correct pages


ggplot2 0.6
----------------------------------------

The two big changes in this release are improved documentation and legends.  

 * all major ggplot2 components now have their own built in documentation, so that (e.g.) ?stat_smooth or ?geom_point now give you useful information
 
 * the legend code is now considerably more sophisticated and will attempt to merge together legends for the same variable
 
 * also, legends are drawn based on the geoms used (instead of the scales used, as previously) so should match the plot much better (e.g. for geom_smooth, geom_boxplot, geom_vline, geom_abline, geom_pointrange).
 
These features are new, so there are likely to be a few bugs that I haven't discovered.  Please me know if you discover any.
 
Other additions and corrections

  * coord_equal: should now work correctly in all situations
  * coord_polar: add start and direction parameters, giving more control over the layout of the polar coords
  * coord_polar: added my favourite pie chart example
  * coord_trans now deals with groups appropriately, at the cost of decreased speed
  * geom_abline, geom_vline, geom_hline: should now behave better in a wider variety of settings
  * geom_boxplot: deals with continuous x-axis and grouping much better
  * geom_boxplot: now has it's own legend which actually looks like a boxplot
  * geom_boxplot: reports if missing values removed
  * geom_crossbar: the middle line is now display thicker than the other lines, controlled by the parameter fatten (thanks to Heike Hofmann for the suggestion)

  * scale_continuous: tweaks to minor breaks to make appearance better on wider range of coordinate systems
  * scale_discrete: all discrete scales now have labels argument which you can use to override the factor levels
  * scale_discrete: now works correctly with character vectors
  * scale_size: changed default range to [0.5, 3] to better reflect new sizing decisions
  * scale_size: legends resize to avoid overlaps
  * scale_x_continuous, scale_y_continuous: new convenience functions xlim and ylim (and zlim) that make it even easier to adjust the limits of the x, y, and z axes
  * stat_bin, geom_area: fixed bug in combination of stat_bin and geom_area that made it difficult to draw frequency polygons
  * stat_bin: fixed bug which resulted in increased counts when the x axis was a categorical variable with a single level (thanks to Bob Muenchen for pointing this out!)
  * stat_bin: no longer incorrectly warns that binwidth is unspecified when breaks are set
  * stat_bin: now takes origin argument to manually specify origin of first bin (default is round_any(min(range), bin_width, floor))

  * stat_summary: better documentation
  * stat_summary: convenient auto wrapping of simple summary functions

Miscellaneous changes:

  * it's now easy to change the default scales (and their arguments) with the set_default_scale function, see ?set_default_scale for more details (thanks to Bob Muenchen for the suggestion)
  * new order aesthetic which controls the order in which elements are plotted
  * min and max are now scaled the same way as y
  * functions are silently dropped (e.g. aes(colour=col))
  * scales do not try and map variables that don't exist (fixes some rather obscure bugs)
  * aes(mpg, wt) is now equivalent to aes(x = mpg, y = wt)


ggplot2 0.5.7
----------------------------------------

New geoms, scales and aesthetics

  * stat_step and geom_step to draw staircase plots (like plot(type="s"))
  * order aesthetic (currently only for lines/paths) allows you to control the drawing order within a group
  * scale_manual makes it easier to let ggplot uses the exact colours/sizes/linetypes that you want
  * scale_reverse allows you to reverse the scale of x and y axes
  * scale_grey is a new black and white scale for categorical data (colour and fill)


Improved options handling

  * new function opts() to allow modification of plot options by addition
  * update(p, theme_bw) and p + theme_bw now work

These changes mean that you can modify plot options in the same way that you modify all other aspects of the plot, e.g.  qplot(mpg, wt, data=mptcars) + opts(title = "Fuel economy vs weight")

Improved documentation

  * many tweaks to the online documentation, particular including the actual code you need to run for each object!
  * every page now has a link to a form where you can submit feedback on exactly you do or don't like about a page
  * required aesthetics now listed in documentation
  * geom_polygon now has a decent example
  * numerous minor corrections suggested by Jörg Beyer
  * separated plotting advice from details of plot construction (what vs how), thanks to Bert Gunter for this suggestion


Improved map projections (with coord_map)

  * coord_map defaults to orientation = c(90, 0, mean(range(y))) - this ensures that multiple layers line up correctly, but means you will have to specify the orientation yourself for many projections 
  * coord_map now respects limits set by scales
  * removed useless ticks from coord_map

If you're using ggplot to draw maps and have thought of other features that would make your life easier, please let me know.


Bug fixes

  * adding data and aesthetics in separate steps should now work
  * layers with set parameters will not use mapped aesthetics
  * use LazyLoad: false instead of SaveData: true for better future compatability

  * coord_cartesian: fixed bug that prevented you from overriding the default axis expansion
  * coord_equal: now scales correctly if ratio < 1
  * geom_abline: fix bug where slope was ignored
  * geom_jitter now works correctly with groups and categorical values (was actually a bug in how scale_discrete deals with continuous values)
  * geom_path: automatically switch between polylineGrob and segmentsGrob when drawing paths so that setting line type now works properly
  * geom_segment now uses both ends of segments to calculate axis limits
  * plotmatrix: fix bug in scatterplot matrix where all scatterplots were transposed!
  * qplot: should now work better within functions
  * quickplot added as an alias of qplot, to avoid confusion with qunif, etc
  * scale_*: better error message if you add a scale without a matching aesthetic mapping in the plot
  * scale_identity no longer converts everything to character
  * scale_identity: grob argument renamed to guide
  * stat_*: made all statistics more robust to errors
  * stat_quantile: fixed bug when only drawing a single quantile
  * stat_smooth: returns silently if <2 non-missing data points


Minor aesthetic improvements

  * coord_polar now specifies aspect.ratio by default, and I've made a few other tweaks to make polar coordinates plot look nicer
  * geom_bar no longer draws gray borders by default, but instead uses the same colour as fill (this eliminates a tiny gap between neighbouring bars)
  * plotmatrix: tweaks to improve display of scatterplot matrix
  * scale_brewer: added option to reverse palette
  * scale_colour: colour and fill legends now look exactly the same (previously colour was missing a grey border)
  * scale_discrete has slightly larger expansion (0.75 vs 0.5)
  * stat_bar: only output bars with > 0 count

  * added median summary
  * new examples:
    * logistic regression example in stat_smooth
